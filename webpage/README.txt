Fast Food Runner:
A web based application that will calculate the maximum quantity of a certain food characteristic specified by the user 
while maintain within the price range which the user also specified. The goal of the application is to be humorous in that
we will search for a fast food restaurant but tell the user to walk or run a certain distance so that they will burn off
the calories they are about to ingest.
